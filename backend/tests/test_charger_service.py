"""Tests for the merged demo+real charger list.

list_chargers()/get_charger() need a DB session (same pattern as the rest of
this project's DB-backed tests), so these use the real TestClient/DB via
app.database.session -- but the REAL-charger mapping and the
isWithinRange-equivalent range-filter regression are pure and tested
directly against fixture dicts, no DB, no network.
