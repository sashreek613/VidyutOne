"""Lyzr-backed "Ask about these sites" planner assistant.

Design rules (see the task this was built against for the full rationale):
  - Lyzr NEVER computes a score, a verdict, or a factor. It only receives
    already-computed data from app/engines/site_scoring.py (via
    site_service.list_recommended_sites) as read-only context and answers
    questions about it. The system prompt (configured in Lyzr Studio, not
    here) is what tells the agent to refuse recalculation requests -- this
    file's only job is to hand it real numbers, never fabricate one itself.
  - Planner-side only, and the context is built purely from data that's
    already public within the app (ranked sites, scores, factors,
    explanations) -- no user PII, no auth tokens, ever included.
  - This is the one place in the backend allowed to make a live external
    network call at request time (everything else is offline-first). Every
    failure mode is caught here and turned into a friendly in-panel string;
    this function must never raise.
